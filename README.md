# Pomodoro Timer App

## Overview
This is a simple **Pomodoro Timer App** that I created for personal use. It is a 1500-second timer (25 minutes), which tracks how long the timer has been running, displaying the total time in minutes and hours. The time can also be set by hours and minutes. 

### Requirements
- Python3
- PyQt6

Note: this can be packaged with PyInstaller to make it into a standalone app.


### Want to do...
- Add a way to track daily focus time for statistical purposes
- Add a way to track which projects a block of time is dedicated to
